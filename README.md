# My Notes

**Chrome Extension** that turns your **"New Tab"** into **a note taking tool.**

- Great for Notes, Todos, and sharing text (Copy/Paste)

- It works immediately after you open a **"New Tab"**

- Every edit and paste is saved (and waiting for you once you come back)

- And! It is Synchronized across every Chrome window you have open
